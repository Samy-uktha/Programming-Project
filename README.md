### Project Goals and Scope

The goal is to create a user-friendly and intuitive shopping experience that replicates or enhances the benefits of traditional retail shopping while leveraging the advantages of digital technology. The scope of a shopping app may vary depending on the specific objectives and target audience. The features and functionalities of a typical shopping app are user registration and profile, product catalog, search and filtering, shopping cart and checkout, and secure payment options.

 
#### Methodology

In a shopping program the methodology typically revolves around principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and classes. Objects are represented as classes in the code. Each class describes the attributes and methods associated with its corresponding object. Encapsulation involves encapsulating the data and methods within a class, and providing controlled access to them through public and private access modifiers. Databases are stored in the code in the form of nested dictionaries in a list.The program covers key  functionalities, such as product listing,  shopping cart, payment processing, and user authentication. For the backend development the  server-side logic of the shopping program was build using the programming language  Python.The programming language is used to design the application.The libraries were imported from tkinter.For minor queries ChatGPT was referred.First user is required  to enter the username and password which after validation directs to second window from where we are allowed to choose the desired  category of products needed.Then it redirects to a third window under where we can locate the  subsections of the desired category,then you will come across the fourth window where you can find the products . Now you can pick out the products you require and you can as well remove the products . Now you will move on to the bill section , where the bill is generated.During  the checkout process, users provide their payment information and other relevant details.Shopping programs often maintain a catalog of products with associated data such as names,card number and cvv.
