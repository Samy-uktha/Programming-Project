SHOPPING PROGRAM -

OBJECTIVE

The goal is to create a user-friendly and intuitive shopping experience that replicates or enhances the benefits of traditional retail shopping while leveraging the advantages of digital technology. 
The features and functionalities of the program are user registration and authentication, product catalog, filtering based on sections and subsections, adding and removing items from cart, displaying the bill data, and payment fields.

APPROACH

Python programming language was used to design the application. We created a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. We used modules in Tkinter such as messagebox, and Treeview widget.
First the user is required to enter the username and password which after validation directs to second window from where we are allowed to choose the desired category of products needed. Then it redirects to a third window under where we can locate the subsections of the desired category, then you will come across the fourth window where you can find the products. 
Now you can pick out the products you require by clicking on the item buttons and you can as well remove the products by clicking on the remove button. 
Now you will move on to the bill section , where the bill is generated. We used the Treeview widget to display the shopping cart data in tabular form, with columns for items, quntity, and price. 
During the checkout process, users provide their payment information such as card number, name, and cvv.
